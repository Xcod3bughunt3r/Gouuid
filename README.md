# The uuid package generates and inspects UUIDs based on [RFC 4122](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) and DCE 1.1: Authentication and Security Services. 

###### This package is based on the https://github.com/Xcod3bughunt3r/Gouuid.git package (previously named code.google.com/p/go-uuid). It differs from these earlier packages in that a UUID is a 16 byte array rather than a byte slice.  One loss due to this change is the ability to represent an invalid UUID (vs a NIL UUID).

###### Install
`go get github.com/Xcod3bughunt3r/Gouuid`
